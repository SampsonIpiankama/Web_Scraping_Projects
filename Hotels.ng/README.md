# Hotels.ng Web Scraping

Hotels.ng is an online travel agency specialising in hotel bookings within Nigeria. They help clients book hotel rooms online. They also provide comprehensive help and support to clients and make the hotel booking process smooth and easy. In addition, they provide hotel recommendations and reviews.

For this project I scraped 854 hotel listings data for hotels in Kaduna, Abuja, Lagos, and Rivers State on the website. 

The data I scraped
- name
- address
- facilities
- average price per night
- rating

# Libraries
For this, I use Selenium to automate the browser. Other libraries that are used include:
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- lxml

# Output
After scraping the data, I carried out data cleaning.
